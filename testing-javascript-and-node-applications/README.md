## guide to testing javascript and node applications

This codebase provides a suite of unit tests for various functions in the application. Each file in the `test` folder contains a series of tests related to a specific module. Here's an overview of each module:

1. `add.spec.js`: This file tests the `add` and `wrong_add` functions from the `add.js` module. The `add` function is expected to return the sum of two numbers, whereas `wrong_add` subtracts the second argument from the first one. The tests check the accuracy of these calculations.

2. `parse-stringify.spec.js`: This file tests the `parse` and `stringify` functions from the `parse-stringify.js` module. The `parse` function is expected to convert a query string into a JavaScript object, and `stringify` should do the reverse operation, converting an object into a query string. The tests verify these conversions.

3. `users.spec.js`: This file tests the `findUserByEmail` and `findUserById` functions from the `users.js` module. These functions are supposed to search for a user in a database by their email or ID. The tests check the correct functionality of these search processes, ensuring the correct user data is returned or an error is thrown when a user is not found.

Overall, this testing suite aims to ensure that the basic functionality of the application behaves as expected. This can help in quickly identifying and fixing any bugs or inconsistencies that might arise during development or maintenance.
