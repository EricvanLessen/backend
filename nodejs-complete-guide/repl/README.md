# Node.js REPL Guide

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It's an interactive environment in Node.js that allows you to run JavaScript commands and get instant feedback. This document provides a brief overview of the Node.js REPL, its features, and how to use it.

## Getting Started

To start the Node.js REPL, open your terminal and simply type:

```bash
node
```

You should be greeted with a `>` prompt. This means the REPL is ready to accept JavaScript commands.

## Features

### Tab Completion

Press the `Tab` key to view available commands and variables. 

### Multiline Expressions

Node.js REPL can handle multiline expressions. It automatically detects incomplete expressions and lets you continue on the next line.

### Command History

Navigate through your command history using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.

### Special Commands

There are commands unique to the REPL environment that start with a period (`.`). Some of them include:

- `.help`: List all command options.
- `.break`: Exit from multiline mode.
- `.clear`: Resets the REPL context.
- `.save <filename>`: Save the current REPL session to a specified file.
- `.load <filename>`: Load a file's content into the current REPL session.

### Exiting the REPL

Press `Ctrl + C` twice or type `.exit`.

## Uses

- **Quick Testing**: Test JavaScript snippets on-the-fly.
- **Learning**: Provides an immediate feedback loop for learners.
- **Debugging**: Check and validate code solutions quickly.

## Limitations

- **Stateless**: Defined variables are lost after exiting the REPL.
- **Not Ideal for Complex Tasks**: For larger projects, use a text editor or IDE and run scripts with `node <filename.js>`.

## Conclusion

Node.js REPL is an invaluable tool for every Node.js developer, ideal for quick experiments, learning, and debugging. While it's not a full-fledged development environment, it offers a quick way to validate and run JavaScript code.
