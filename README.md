# Backend Development Practice Projects (Node.js & TypeScript)

Welcome to the Backend Development Practice Projects repository! This repository is designed to showcase a collection of practice projects for backend development using Node.js and TypeScript.

## Project Structure

Each project in this repository focuses on a specific aspect of backend development and demonstrates best practices and implementation techniques. The projects are organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a different project.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository utilize the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## How to Use

To explore the practice projects and learn from their implementations, simply navigate to the desired project's directory. Each project contains a detailed README file that provides information on the project's purpose, functionality, and instructions on how to run or deploy it.

Feel free to browse through the projects, study the code, and experiment with different approaches. These practice projects are designed to enhance your backend development skills and provide hands-on experience with common backend tasks and concepts.
