# Parallelization in Node.js

This repository provides examples and explanations for different approaches to parallelize code in Node.js. It covers the following techniques:

1. Cluster Module
2. Worker Threads
3. Child Process
4. Message Queues

## Cluster Module

The cluster module in Node.js allows you to create a cluster of worker processes that share the same server port. It leverages the power of multiple CPUs by forking worker processes, enabling parallel processing. Each worker runs on a separate CPU core, allowing your Node.js application to utilize the available resources effectively.

Example:
```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  // Workers can share any TCP connection
  // In this case, it is an HTTP server
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello from worker');
  }).listen(8000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

## Worker Threads

The worker_threads module in Node.js allows you to create lightweight threads that can execute JavaScript code in parallel. It provides an API for creating and managing worker threads, enabling you to offload computationally intensive tasks to separate threads.

Example:
```javascript
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

// Create a new worker thread
const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');

// Listen for messages from the worker
worker.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log(`Received message from worker: ${message}`);
});

// Send a message to the worker
worker.postMessage('Hello from main thread');
```

## Child Process

The child_process module in Node.js enables you to create and manage child processes. You can spawn new instances of Node.js or execute other command-line programs as child processes. This allows you to parallelize tasks by distributing them across multiple child processes.

Example:
```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

// Execute a command in a child process
exec('ls -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout:\n${stdout}`);
});
```

## Message Queues

Message queues provide a way to distribute and process tasks in a distributed manner. Libraries like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka can be used to implement message queues in Node.js. Tasks are divided into smaller units and distributed across multiple worker processes or machines. Workers consume tasks from the queue, process them, and send the results back.

Example (using RabbitMQ):
```javascript
const amqp = require('amqplib');

// Connect to RabbitMQ
const connect = async () => {
  try {
    const connection = await amqp.connect('amqp://localhost');
    const channel = await connection.createChannel();

    const queue = 'task_queue';

    // Send a task to the queue
    channel.assertQueue(queue, { durable: true });
    channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from('Task data'));

    // Consume tasks from the queue
    channel.consume(queue, (message) => {
      const task = message.content.toString();
      console.log(`Received task: ${task}`);

      // Process the task

      // Send the result back

      channel.ack(message);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error}`);
  }
};

connect();
```

## Shared Buffers

Shared buffers allow multiple JavaScript threads (worker_threads) to access the same memory region concurrently. They enable efficient data sharing and communication between threads, making it possible to perform parallel computations on shared data without unnecessary data copying.

Example:
```javascript
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

// Create a SharedArrayBuffer
const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(16);

// Create a new worker thread and pass the shared buffer
const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData: sharedBuffer });

// Listen for messages from the worker
worker.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log(`Received message from worker: ${message}`);
});

// Send a message to the worker
worker.postMessage('Hello from main thread');
```

## Conclusion

Parallelizing code is crucial for optimizing performance and utilizing available resources efficiently. Node.js provides various mechanisms like the cluster module, worker_threads, child_process, and message queues to achieve parallel execution. Additionally, shared buffers enable efficient data sharing between worker threads.

Each technique has its own advantages and use cases, so choose the appropriate approach based on your specific requirements.
